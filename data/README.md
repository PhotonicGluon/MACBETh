# MACBETh - Data
This data folder should contain a single directory, `json`, containing VirusTotal reports. The format for the names of the JSON files should be `[LABEL]_[HASH].json`, where `[LABEL]` is the (guessed) label of the malware sample and `[HASH]` is the SHA256 hash of the sample.

You can download VirusTotal reports using the scraper included.

Original hashes for the malware was obtained from [here](https://github.com/eminunal1453/Various-Malware-Hashes/blob/main/hashes.txt). The `hashes.txt` file is a partially cleaned-up version of the file after searching for some hashes on VirusTotal.
