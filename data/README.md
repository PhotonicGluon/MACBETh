# MACBETH - Data
This data folder should contain a single directory, `json`, containing VirusTotal reports. The format for the names of the JSON files should be `[LABEL]_[HASH].json`, where `[LABEL]` is the (guessed) label of the malware sample and `[HASH]` is the SHA256 hash of the sample.

You can download VirusTotal reports using [this tool](https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/VirusTotal-Reports-Scraper) that I made.
